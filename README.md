# ML_OCR_10_2019
October 2019 Presentation on Machine Learning as applied to OCR and text classification

# Theory
## Types of Machine Learning
* Classification
* Clustering
* Regressions
* Feature Engineering / Dimensionality Reduction 

* Cleanup

## More/better data > better algorithms

* The Unreasonable
Effectiveness of Data

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences

* Google reCaptcha - are we all working for Google now?
* Deep Mind

### Bleeding State of Art
* Deep Fakes
* GAN - Adversial Networks

### Hype vs Reality
* The many pseudo AI groups - MTurk vs real AI
* Practicality - Netflix Challenge

## Importance of Domain Knowledge 
* Triangle of Data Science goes here

# Practice

## Goal improve accuracy of heuristics based OCR systems

## Case Study in progres - Gothic Arktur for Latvian texts

### Setup
* Tesseract
* OCR-D

### HyperParameters
* Tuning

### Base 

* Abby Arktur
* Foxit
